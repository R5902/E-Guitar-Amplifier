# E-Guitar-Amplifier
That's my repo for my project for blueprint event. I wanna make an electric guitar and an Amplifier. All that from scratch.

I'll take wood panels and glue them to make the main guitar body and the neck. Then will buy the guitar pickups, the bridge, the jack output, the potentiometers, the switch, the wires, the tuner machine on the neck, the fret, the pickup guard and the neck plate.

For the Amplifier, I'll wood work the amp body and will design a pcb for amplification, then buy the pcb, the buttons, the potentiometers and the speaker.
